# Welcome to Fjordheim

The cold winds blow across the northern shores, carrying with them tales of both bounty and doom. You are the elder of **Fjordheim**, a small fishing village clinging to life on the edge of the frozen sea.

## Your Responsibility

Five souls depend on your wisdom. Each turn, you must decide their fate:
- Send them to **fish** the dark waters for sustenance
- Order them to **cut wood** from the ancient forests for fuel and shelter

## The Harsh Reality

The Norse winter is unforgiving:
- Your people must **eat each turn** or face starvation
- Without hope, **morale** will crumble and the village will fall into despair
- The draugr—restless dead—lurk in the shadows, drawn by suffering

## Your Goal

Survive. Prosper if you can. But above all, keep your people alive and their spirits strong.

May the gods watch over Fjordheim.
